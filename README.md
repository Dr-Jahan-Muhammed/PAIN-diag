# Pain Diagnostic Website — Upload Instructions

1. Create a GitHub account (github.com) if you don't have one.
2. Create a new repository, name it e.g. `pain-diagnostic-site`, set it Public.
3. Upload files: Use "Add file → Upload files" for all files and folders (`index.html`, `diagnose.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, `privacy.html`, `disclaimer.html`, `assets/` folder, `.nojekyll`).
4. Commit changes.
5. Go to repository **Settings → Pages**.
   - Under **Source**, choose **main branch** and **root** folder.
   - Save.
6. After a minute, your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/pain-diagnostic-site`.

## Replace diagnose.html
- Open `diagnose.html` in your editor and replace the placeholder comment with the full 100-question HTML (the large file you already have) or paste your file content entirely.

## Add pages & AdSense
- Add About/Contact/Privacy content (already included). For AdSense, you need a few pages and apply for approval.

## Custom domain (optional)
- Buy domain (Namecheap/GoDaddy), add `CNAME` file with domain, and configure DNS per GitHub Pages instructions.

## Collecting results
- By default this is client-side only. To collect results, integrate a backend (Google Forms webhook, Netlify forms, Firebase). I can add that if wanted.
```

## `.nojekyll`

Create a blank file named `.nojekyll` (no content). This prevents GitHub from processing with Jekyll.

## Next steps I can do for you (choose any):

1. Paste your **full 100-question HTML** into `diagnose.html` for you and return the full combined file (if you paste the HTML here I will insert it).
2. Create a polished **single ZIP** of all files (I can prepare the zipped content in the canvas).
3. Add **CSV export** or simple Google Sheets integration for result collection.
4. Add **AdSense placeholder** and instructions for applying.

Tell me which next step you want and I will prepare it.
